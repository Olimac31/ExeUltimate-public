I [color=yellow]coded[/color] the entire mod and now I'm [shake level=7]fucking dead[/shake][wave] LMAO[/wave]

I also composed [color=red]Too Goofy[/color] alongside Trains, charted it, helped with [color=fuchsia]UI stuff[/color], implemented all assets, etc.
I'm also [color=lime]Director[/color] apparently, even though I have NO idea how I ended up being one

I'm [color=yellow]thankful[/color] for everyone who put their blood and sweat into this funny little project :)
[center]Hope yall like the mod![/center]

description = "Heya, I'm Maxitox. I'm a charter, composer, and the guy who made [color=yellow]Team Advance[/color], a group of former Novatos Team members [color=gray](ye, the ones from VS. Mouse)[/color] and other veterans who currently take care of various FNF mod projects, including the same one you're playing right now!

I'm co-director, I came up with the name of this mod as a joke referencing [color=red]VS. Mouse Ultimate[/color] (ironic since I named both mods LMAO) and I was in charge of [color=aqua]brainstorming some ideas[/color] which haven't been implemented yet. Maybe they will, [wave]but who knows?[/wave]


Keep an eye for future [color=yellow]Team Advance[/color] projects, which includes mods about Console-tans, Evangelion, UNDERTALE, Murder Drones and many more!"

I made literally [color=yellow]every single menu theme[/color] in the mod, that was all me. I hope you liked them all, because I will [wave]DEFINITELY[/wave] be doing every single song in every upcoming update, don't trust Oli's lies. 

I also have my own EXE mod, [color=aqua]EXE: RT[/color], which you should [wave]TOTALLY[/wave] check out instead of this [shake level=8]GARBAGE.[/shake]




Also subscribe to me. Have I mentioned that already? Probably, who cares."

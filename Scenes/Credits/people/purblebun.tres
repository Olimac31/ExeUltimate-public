I used to be the director of this project, but honestly, I didn’t do a great job. I was pretty inexperienced, and it was obvious I wasn’t ready to handle such a project. My contributions were mostly early ideas and concepts [color=gray](and, yeah, most of them weren’t that great).[/color]

That’s why I’m so happy to see Vs. Sonic.exe Ultimate in better hands now! I really hope I can keep contributing to the project and help it grow even more in the future.

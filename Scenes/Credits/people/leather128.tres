description = "Leather128 created [color=aqua]Leather Engine[/color], the engine we used as a base for the mod!

They recreated the entire [color=fuchsia]Friday Night Funkin'[/color] engine in [color=aqua]Godot 3[/color], and released the source code so anyone could take it and modify it.

It was discontinued around early 2023, but since we picked it up we've been adding new features and reworking stuff to make it easier for us to use.

Thank you for all your hard work!"

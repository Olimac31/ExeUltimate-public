We chose it over the traditional Haxe-based engines because a lot of things we wanted were easier to do here

[color=aqua]Godot Engine[/color] is a cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.
It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that you can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel.


Maybe you should give it a try! It's [color=lime]free, open source, and really intuitive[/color] to learn and use :)"
